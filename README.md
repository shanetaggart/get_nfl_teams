# get_nfl_teams
<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>This Wordpress plug-in was developed to dynamically pull a list of NFL teams and related information from an API, to then display it on a page in a user-friendly format.</p> 

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>Use the shortcode <code>[teams]</code> to display the information on the page. There are three ways to sort the data on screen represented by three buttons:</p>

<ul>
    <li>City</li>
    <li>Conference</li>
    <li>Division</li>
</ul>

<h3>Project Justifications</h3>

<p>This plug-in was designed using the Twenty Twenty One theme on dark mode. Some styles may not work well with other themes or light mode. I chose to build this plug-in this way in the preference of development time. I focused more on the functionality of the plug-in and basic design of the cards, not so much on the theme.</p>

<p>As part of this, it became necessary to utilize <code>!important</code> in order to overcome conflicts with the theme's CSS. If this were a live project, I would aspire to building a full theme for ACME Sports in order accommodate their needs and this plug-in.</p>
